        <h3>Recycling turns our waste materials into new useful products.</h3>
        <p>This reduces the use of finite raw materials, saves energy and helps
          control air, water and land pollution.
          Recycling is a group effort. We all have our part to play to not only
          recycle as much waste as possible but to also make sure our recycling
          is properly sorted.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Recycling that includes non-recyclable items or is contaminated with food
          waste can end up in landfill.
          It only takes a few minutes to rinse out plastic, glass and tin
          containers and sort our cardboard to avoid a disposal problem that will
          live with future generations for hundreds or even thousands of years.

        <h2>What is my impact?</h2>
        <h3>The environmental issues facing our planet are so huge and one person
          can only do so much. </h3>
        <p>But it’s surprising how much difference one person
          can make and if we all do our bit then the impact is amplified many
          times over.
        </p>
        <p>
          The choices we make, from the products we buy to the recycling we do every
          day, can have a real impact on the world around us, by reducing our
          environmental footprint and influencing the decisions of manufacturers,
          retailers and politicians. Together, we can make a positive impact for a
          cleaner, healthier future.

          No matter where you are on your journey, there is a positive environmental
          impact that you can make.
          The reason that waste prevention is top of the management pyramid is
          simple – the less waste we produce the less we have to care for.
        </p>
        <p>Education is key to the prevention of waste and wastage or avoidable
          waste. If people are more informed about waste then maybe they will stop
          and think before buying a product that is in a lot of packaging or they
          might consider renting or borrowing items which they may only use once or
          twice a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Continuing dependence on landfills and waste to energy to handle our
          waste means Ireland ranks near the bottom of the pyramid, we need to move
          upwards towards waste prevention. We can all help to reduce the amount of
          waste by cutting down what we consume. It is then important to recycle or
          compost any suitable material and to dispose of the rest in a safe manner.

          It’s easy to think that prevention and using your recycling bin
          doesn’t make much difference. Just look at the facts and think again.

        <h2>What can I do to be more sustainable?</h2>
        <h3>Sustainable living isn’t just about recycling.</h3>
  
        <p>It’s a lifestyle that reduces our environmental impact in many ways, from the food we buy to the daily commute.
          There is no right or wrong way to live sustainably, you simply need to do whatever works for you and remember
          the small things matter.
        </p>
  
        <p>Food waste, for example, isn’t just about scraping leftovers into the food waste bin. We need to make choices
          that support
          local farmers and cut down on air miles, that reject excessive packaging and wasteful over-purchasing.
          Never buy more than you need and get creative with leftovers: you’ll be surprised how little food you waste and
          how much money you save.
        </p>
  
        <p>Avoid single use items like plastic drinks bottles, take-away coffee cups and wipes. Use a re-usable cup, carry
          your own bottle to fill up
          with tap water and use washable flannels to remove make-up or mop up after babies.
        </p>
  
        <p>Try to cut down on harsh cleaning products, which can contain hazardous substances that pollute water courses
          and be harmful to health.
          There are many natural alternatives, such as vinegar and baking soda, that can make your kitchen shine without
          polluting your house with
          chemicals and excessive plastic bottles.
        </p>
  
        <p>Finally, think before you buy: do you really need it? Is there a version without so much plastic packaging?
          We are lucky enough to live in a part of the world where our problem is waste, not want.
        </p>
        <p>Let’s reuse, recycle and repair to make the
          most of what we already have, and preserve the earth’s precious finite resources for future generations.
